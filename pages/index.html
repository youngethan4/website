      <p class="text">  
        My name is Ethan Young and I graduated from Iowa State University in spring 2020 with a degree in computer engineering with a focus area in software engineering. 
        I have been interested in technology and engineering since my early days of high school where I was fortunate enough to take the PLTW pathway as well as a software 
        development course. While I was unsure of what specific path I wanted to go as I started college as a computer engineer, I later found out that my passion resided in software.

      <p class = "text">My personal research project was the best thing that I have ever done and it was a major stepping stone for me and my software development learning. 
        I really started to understand the architecture of a full-stack application and all the bits and pieces that put it together. Previously in class, I was only doing 
        the front-end coding, so learning the whole stack was an amazing experience for my first time. I took this knowledge I learned and continued throughout my school 
        projects and emphasized learning about principals and patterns in design to ensure that I came up with industry-standard code. I also have made a lot of progress 
        with testing my code through Junit in Java and Jest and Enzyme in JavaScript. My Jest and Enzyme testing was for my recent React project. This project was a single-page 
        web application focusing on real-time collaboration with sticky notes. I am now transitioning to a multi-page app with React Router as well as starting to figure out the 
        Redux pattern.  If you would like more information about these projects, click <a href = "projects" class="link">here</a>.
