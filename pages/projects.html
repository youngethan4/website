            <p class="textProject">
              Throughout my Senior Design project, I was collaborating among a team of three other talented individuals as we set foot creating a black box for Iowa’s Department of Transportation vehicles. The goal entailed engineering smart-sensing hardware and software to collect road roughness data using the International Roughness Index (IRI) standard. We achieved this goal by using an Arduino Uno along with a GPS module, an accelerometer module, and an SD card module. I personally contributed to the front-end website, back-end, and database creation as well as assisting debugging on the Arduino when we had complex issues.

              -  IRI calculations based on the Golden Car Model.<br>
              -  The Arduino itself had on-board speed and g-force filtering to extend SD card space with compliance of the IRI standard.<br>
              -  Once data has been collected on the SD card after driving around, the user can eject the SD card and upload the data via a laptop or computer through a website that uploads the data to the Cloud.<br>
              -  We did realize that having multi-threading support would have significantly improved our prototype by providing the capability to directly upload data from the black box to the Cloud in good coverage zones as well as increasing the polling speed of the accelerometer.

              Note Collab is a project that started out as a school project and was evolved to a far greater point afterward for fun. The app is geared towards idea generation sessions for designers and engineers as well as throughout the Agile process. In a nutshell, the teams can create sticky notes and collaborate with one another as they would on a whiteboard. During the initial development in class, I had a partner that was working on the front-end while I worked on the back-end. However, towards the end, after many tries of trying to get him to learn and understand React, I had to take over as a full-stack developer to finish the project on time.

              This was my first experience with full-stack development, which required a lot of research and learning. For the back-end of the application, I was able to use my own personal server that I already owned for multiple years and utilize ssh. During development, I really messed around with as many options as I could as well as tried my hardest to focus on code reusability wherever I could. I was able to use the same game activity for all modes of the game which I was pleased by. While I really wanted to continue to make multiplayer support for the application, I lost interest after a while and did not want to continue down the gaming path.

              Drinker's Choice was another app I did as a class project that took my passion to a whole new level. This app was made for people to post drinks, get rides, and see business promotions about drinks. Throughout the project, I worked on the front-end side of development while implementing all the various features. There were still some bugs at the end of the semester that would have been squashed given enough time.

This experience taught me a lot about working with a team and the different schedules they may have. I also got to get experience with an agile-like development environment using the Trello board.

The device works by encrypting information and hiding it, as well as the encryption key, into photos so as to not be obvious.
