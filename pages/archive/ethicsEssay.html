    <br/><h1 class="heading"><strong>Ethics Essay</strong></h1>
    <p class="textProject">
      Keeping good ethical standards is important for any sized company whether it be thousands of employees or a self-owned business.
      Companies need to be ethical in how they handle purchases, user information, and much more. As engineers, we have a critical part
      in this role as we create the processes, equipment, and software used at companies and everyone's daily lives. The IEEE code of ethics
      helps engineers in ethical matters by giving a skeleton on what to follow and how to make the best decisions. This also creates a unity in
      ethical approaches for engineers around the world.
    </p>

    <p class="textProject">
      I personally am studying software related courses within the computer engineering discipline. One major ethical obligation from a software
      standpoint is to engineer application with the public interest in mind. While creating and maintaining a software related application,
      there needs to be ethical procedures to ensure that the software is in the public's best interest. This is important because the main
      reason to create any application is for people to use or benefit from it. It is extremely important that the software is free from any
      data mistakes or misinformation. If an application intentionally was to tell a meteorologist the wrong temperature outside or a wrong weather
      trend, then it does not put the public interest in mind. If something like this was just a mistake, the ethical approach would be to notify
      the public that something is wrong in the data and to patch it immediately.

    </p>

    <p class="textProject">
      Within small groups in my recent class, we discussed an Amazon echo issue and a Volkswagen (VW) issue. The VW issue was about how VW was
      using intelligent software to fake its emissions testing while the Amazon echo issue was about a man who was killed in a house that had an
      amazon echo listening. I am going to go into further detail about the Amazon Echo issue as I thought it was much more interesting. Amazon
      says they keep everything that you say in a hearable distance to the echo in order to improve their devices. This begs the question then if
      the police are allowed to contact amazon to get this data, or if Amazon needs to let users keep their privacy. In the case of the man who
      was killed, the police would be able to identify who the murder was much easier with the data. If Amazon does not allow the police to access
      people's data, there is still an uneasy feeling knowing that everything you say in a room is essentially being recorded. The police could
      need a written agreement from the owner of the device, but the owner of the device may not be the only one present in the room of the echo.
      Would this mean they would require all the persons signatures who were present to get the data then? This question I did not consider until
      someone else brought it up within the group. There is no right answer here though, it is about opinion and how strongly one would feel about
      which option is more ethical.

    </p>

    <p class="textProject">
      In my group, we never really all agreed on what the best option is in this case. We want customer privacy, but on the other hand, we could
      potentially save a life down the road if we can get to a murderer sooner. Furthermore, if Amazon states it will not allow governmental
      consumption of records, we will have to trust them as consumers to reject bribery. This could not even be governmental bribery. I believe
      the best ethical approach that keeps the public interest in mind would be to give police access to data when something like a murder happens.
      This will have to be a fine line which tells Amazon when this information can be given up without all partiesâ€™ written approval. But I
      believe murder should be the only case in which the government would be allowed records. Otherwise, I think all records should be kept
      confidential even from the owner them self. I believe this would be best among alternatives, because finding a murderer is more essential
      for public wellbeing and safety than protecting a single conversation in my opinion. I think Amazon should be allowed to collect this information
      in general because if a user is so upset over the collection of information, I do not think they would want to use this service anyway. Amazon is
      responsible to protect this information though to the highest degree.
    </p>

    <p class="textProject">
      This responsibility translates to the virtue of ethics. The virtue of ethics includes integrity, honesty, fidelity, charity, responsibility,
      and self-discipline. I believe the Amazon Echo case matches up with responsibility, honesty, and integrity the most. Amazon has a responsibility
      to act in the highest moral way with the sensitive data that they obtain. They need to be honest to the consumer in the terms of service which
      describes the echo and what they plan to do with the data. Amazon also has the duty to practice good and ethical judgement which translates to
      integrity. The other three virtues I do not think fit as well with the Amazon echo issue because of the following reasons. Charity with the
      willingness to help others when in need which implies that amazon would give out the sensitive data more freely. This does not line up with
      my thoughts on the ethical approach of keeping all the data secure. Self-discipline also does not line up as well as the three I chosen because
      if Amazon is only able to give up data when murder is present, they will not have to internally decide for each case brought up. This will be
      pre decided. Lastly, fidelity is a virtue that I thought of including in my top three for the Amazon Echo case. The reason I decided not to
      is because many times the public has varying views about the issue at hand as I saw with the differences in the group discussion. Being faithful
      to everyone would be extremely hard to accomplish. Another virtue I have seen has been generosity, which does not make sense in the Amazon Echo
      case. I have not seen any other issues outside the three chosen that would fit nicely into the Amazon Echo case.
