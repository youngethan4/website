    <p class="textProject">
      General education courses at Iowa State University have taught me a few things throughout my time at Iowa State University. General Education courses are to learn more broadly with the requirement of only taking five classes. Four of the five general education courses that I have been a part of were Management 310: Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Integrated Studio Arts 201: Creative Visual Thinking, Psychology 101: Introduction to Psychology, and Human Development and Family Sciences 239: Consumer Issues. Even though these were not directly related to my course of study, they still shed some light that I had not previously considered. I will briefly go over three of the four courses and how they will help me in my future engineering career.

      The one class that would be obviously the most related to engineering would be Entrepreneurship and Innovation. This class went in-depth with how one would think about new innovations which is an Engineers job. It also went into the costs pertaining to creating a company and everything that is needed for success. There was a project in the class that included making a small innovative product to sell. The profits for the project were then donated to a charity that pertained to the product which we sold. I’m my project group, we make small 3-D printed animal key-chains which were for the World Wildlife Fund. The process of idea generation and execution was a great skill to pick up that will help in the future even if key-chains are not that innovative.

      Creative Visual Thinking also had some good knowledge related to my career path. The class, in general, related to design which goes hand-in-hand when working on software projects. Most notably this would be prevalent in software projects where there will be an end-user in mind. This would require designs to achieve the best user experience through an interface. Creative Visual Thinking taught me about design choices and some principals that go along with them that would make a design stand out more. While this class was more of a struggle for me, I can still take what I learned onto future endeavors.

      Lastly, Consumer Issues went over both sides of consumer law and political arguments related. This is helpful to know as an engineer because being unbiased is always preferable as the most ethical approach. One big issue that I remember the most from this class was the issue pertaining to climate change and what consumers can do to help earth out. This then stems into what engineers are currently doing to help the earth out. Some examples of this would be the ability for users to have automatic lights, air conditioning and heater units, and electrical cars. There is much more work to be done in this area for all types of engineers.

    <p class="textProject">
      General Education requirements are there to give different views on issues that are faced around the world. These issues may not directly correlate to the specific course of study being taken, but can help nonetheless. Trying to make connections to one’s major based on these experiences will most undoubtedly make the classes integrate more within one’s future ambitions. This is what I have tried to continue to do throughout my educational experience at Iowa State University.
