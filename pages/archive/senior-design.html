      <p class="textProject">
          My senior design project includes three others: Mike, Victor, and Shlok. The project entails gathering road roughness samples
          and calculating the International Roughness Index (IRI) for the particular sample. This project was given to us by the Iowa Department
          of Transportation (IowaDOT). The main goals for the project are to gather the data and send it
          to a cloud server, figure out the sample size as the data comes in, calculate the rougness for the sample, and save that data to
          a database. To collect the data from the roads while driving, we are using a Arduino Uno, which has very limited capabilities, and therefore
          is the reason we will be figuring out the sampling size and the IRI calculation on the Microsoft Azure cloud server. There is also a stretched
          goal of creating a user interface to interact with the data that is being collected. This would be done through using the OpenLayers API and React JS.
      </p>
      <p class="textProject">
          The main role I have for this project is project manager. I make sure that the git is up to date and that everyone is commiting what they have done.
          I also initiate meeting setups which include primarily of asking for peoples schedules and configuring a good meeting time where we all are available.
          I also do a lot of work on the software side of things. This has included compressing libraries to fit them all on the Uno, setting up the Node JS server
          and configuring it with the MySQL database, and converting the IRI calculation given to us in Fortran to JavaScript.
