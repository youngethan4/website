    <p class="textProject">
      My time at Iowa State University has been nothing short of an abundance of knowledge. I came into the university in fall of 2016 not knowing exactly what I had planned for the future, but I did, however, come in knowing two things: I loved technology and I had previous engineering experience through Project Lead the Way. With these two things in mind, I started off my college career in Computer Engineering hoping it would take me somewhere enjoyable. I was definitely not mistaken. It took a while to get into my sub-area within Computer Engineering which I found to be a different major all together, Software Engineering. To my luck though, there was a focus area for Computer Engineers that allowed them to take any of the Software Engineering courses offered.

    <p class="textProject">
      The passion I obtained for Software Engineering came to me during Computer Science 309: Software Development. During this class, I was in a team of three people creating an Android application. This was my first time that I was creating an application from the ground up with minimal guidance. The project was pretty open-ended which increased original ideas and creativity, a core concept in Engineering, and was an entire semester long. Throughout the project I learned how to use back-end Application Programing Interfaces, communicate through HTTP requests, and create front-end user interfaces. As a direct result of learning these, I quickly came to realize that the learning never ended within the vast realm of software.

      As a result of my enthusiasm for the software development course, I started researching on my own about Android applications and began work on a second one. As my previous learning experience was mostly with the user interface and front-end code, I set out to create a full-stack application, and I was excited to begin learning about back-end structure and database design. I found myself using much of what I learned in my coursework including, but not limited to, object-oriented design principles, different types of patterns, and my developed problem solving skills. I impressed myself with the knowledge I was able to apply from my coursework and knew it was the beginning of my focus within Software Engineering.

    </p>

    <p class="textProject">
      Over the past year with my focus area in Software Engineering, I have definitely learned most of what I know about Software Engineering problems. These include reusability, performance, and reliability. New ways to solve these problems come to light in the community often which is why it is important to keep learning new techniques and best practices. This is especially important with new frameworks coming out every year. The current trend for applications is web applications. These solve the client issue of having to download applications and new updates as well as deployment issues. There are some downsides though including internet reliability. These are examples of learning objectives from my software architecture and design principles classes which facilitate continuous learning.

    <p class="textProject">
      As I sit here right now and type out this reflection, I can tell I will have success in the discipline I chose for myself because of the great opportunity I had at Iowa State University. I have grown my skills so much through the problems I have encountered with my coursework and personal experiences. Throughout all of the future problems I will face as an Engineer, I know I can look back, see what I accomplished so far, and get to work. I believe there is no problem too big to solve; the only thing standing in the way is time. Time to research and get all the details answered. Time to incrementally move forward step by step with any failures becoming nothing but a learning experience.
